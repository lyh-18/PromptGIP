# PromptGIP [ICML2024]

## Unifying Image Processing as Visual Prompting Question Answering

This paper was accepted by The Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML2024). [[Arxiv]]()

We propose a universal model for general image processing that covers image restoration, image enhancement, image feature extraction tasks, etc. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain tasks using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for taskspecific finetuning. Capable of handling up to 15 different image processing tasks, PromptGIP represents a versatile and adaptive approach to general image processing.
